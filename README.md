# gnu-plotutils
A fork of gnu plotutils with fixes applied

## Motivation

The official version doesn't seem to be supported any more.  But this
code is used by the modern biggles plotting package as a back end.

## Installation Dependencies

On ubuntu at least the following are needed

sudo apt install build-essential libx11-dev libxft-dev libxt-dev libxaw7-dev libpng-dev
